# Bootstrap_Bio

The Bootstrap Bio activity was to create a customized website that includes links to projects I've done, some general information and a contact section. 

The background image on the about me page is from https://www.vecteezy.com/vector-art/101253-free-abstract-background-1  and the other images are my own. 

I used HTML and Bootstrap to build the website, focusing on making sure it works on mobile devices as well as larger devices. 

On the portfolio section, you can see my 4 most recent coding projects.
