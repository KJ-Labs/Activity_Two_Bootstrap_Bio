# Activity_Two_Bootstrap_Bio

The Bootstrap Bio activity was to create a customized website that includes links to projects I've done, some general information and a contact section. 

The corgi on the about me page is from https://dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2016/08/corgi-puppy-6-e1573588370274-1280x720.jpg  and the other images are my own. 

I used HTML and Bootstrap to build the website, focusing on making sure it works on mobile devices as well as larger devices. On the portfolio section, I plan to update the painting card and cat card with more projects once I finish them. 

Thanks,
